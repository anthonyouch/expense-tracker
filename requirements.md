# App Requirements: Expense Tracker (Version 3)

## 1. Overview
Version 3 enhances the Expense Tracker by introducing a **web-based frontend** and **cloud deployment**, making it more accessible and user-friendly while retaining the robust backend capabilities developed in Version 2.

## 2. Core Features (Extended)

1. **Web-Based Frontend**  
   - **Requirement**: Replace the console-based interface with a web-based frontend.  
   - **Rationale**: Improve usability and accessibility for a broader audience.  
   - **Implementation Details**:  
     - Use **HTML/CSS** and **Bootstrap** for a clean, responsive design.  
     - Build interactive pages for key functionalities:
       - Dashboard with summaries and reports.
       - Add Expense form with input validation.
       - View Expenses page (includes recurring expenses).

2. **Cloud Deployment**  
   - **Requirement**: Deploy the application to the cloud to allow multi-device, real-time access.  
   - **Rationale**: Enable users to access their data from any device with internet connectivity.  
   - **Implementation Details**:  
     - Use platforms like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **Netlify** for hosting.  
     - Configure a cloud database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite in a cloud instance).  
     - Set up deployment pipelines for seamless updates.

3. **Frontend Interactivity**  
   - **Requirement**: Add dynamic, user-friendly features to the web interface.  
   - **Rationale**: Enhance the user experience with real-time feedback and updates.  
   - **Implementation Details**:  
     - Use **JavaScript** for client-side functionality:
       - Real-time input validation for forms.
       - Dynamic updates to summaries on the dashboard.

4. **Backend Integration**  
   - **Requirement**: Connect the frontend to the existing backend for seamless data processing.  
   - **Rationale**: Leverage the robust backend developed in Version 2 to handle database operations and recurring expenses.  
   - **Implementation Details**:  
     - Use APIs or server-side scripts to bridge the frontend and backend.
     - Update backend logic as needed to support frontend requests.

## 3. User Flow (High-Level)

1. **Dashboard**  
   - Users see a summary of their expenses (e.g., total monthly expenses, top categories).  

2. **Add Expense**  
   - Users fill out a form to add an expense (name, category, amount, recurring flag, etc.).  
   - Real-time form validation for required fields and valid input types.  

3. **View Expenses (Includes Recurring Expenses)**  
   - A table displays all expenses, including recurring expenses.  

---

## 4. Constraints
- **Web-Based Only**: This version introduces a web interface, eliminating the console-based UI.  
- **Cloud-Hosted**: The application must be accessible over the internet with minimal downtime.  
- **Frontend Simplicity**: The design prioritizes usability and clean layouts, avoiding overly complex or resource-heavy features.  
- **No Mobile-Friendliness**: The frontend will not be optimized for mobile devices in this version.

## 5. Technical Design

1. **Frontend Components**  
   - **Dashboard**: Display summaries and trends (e.g., pie chart for top categories).  
   - **Add Expense**: Form for adding expenses, including validation and feedback.  
   - **View Expenses**: Table displaying all expenses, including recurring expenses.

2. **Backend Integration**  
   - **APIs**: Define endpoints for CRUD operations:
     - `POST /add_expense`
     - `GET /get_expenses`
     - `PUT /update_expense`
     - `DELETE /delete_expense`  
   - **Database**: Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL or SQLite.

3. **Cloud Deployment**  
   - **Hosting**: Use Heroku or AWS for deploying the frontend and backend.  
   - **Database**: Configure a secure, scalable cloud database instance.  

4. **Error Handling**  
   - Frontend: Provide user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs or failed backend requests.  
   - Backend: Gracefully handle database exceptions and invalid API requests.

## 6. Testing

1. **Unit Tests**  
   - Test frontend functionality (form validation, dynamic updates) with tools like Jest or Mocha.  
   - Verify backend APIs for proper CRUD operations.  

2. **Integration Tests**  
   - Test the entire flow: adding an expense via the web interface, checking its persistence in the database, and viewing it on the dashboard.  

3. **Manual User Testing**  
   - Ensure the web interface is intuitive and works across devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).  

4. **Deployment Testing**  
   - Verify the application works as expected on the cloud platform, including real-time updates and accessibility from multiple devices.

## 7. Future Enhancements

- **Data Visualization**: Add more interactive and advanced charts using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.  
- **User Accounts**: Implement authentication for multi-user support.  
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Optimize the web interface for mobile screens.  
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Send alerts for recurring expenses or large transactions.  
- **Offline Mode**: Allow expense tracking even without an internet connection, syncing when back online.
